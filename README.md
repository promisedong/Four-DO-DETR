1. The article information
Xinyue Zhao, Haowen Zhang, Dong Liu*, Guanxiong Lei. 4DO-DETR: DN-DAB-Deformable DETR with Denser connection and Entropy-balanced loss for otitis media detection.
The article is under review in Scientific Reports.


3. Experimental dataset
(1) Otitis1415 dataset
We used the Otitis1415 dataset, which consists of CT images from 2014 to 2024 at the hospital affiliated with Xiangnan University. 
The dataset includes 4,216 images of OM cases. We randomly divided the dataset into two parts: 3,280 images for the training set, 
used to train the model, and the remaining 936 images for the validation set, used to evaluate the model’s performance. 
Each image in the dataset is annotated with a ground truth box indicating the position of the middle ear.
This dataset is too large to upload to the GITHUB repository. So we upload to Baidu web disk, please feel free to download.
The Otitis1415 dataset can be downloaded via the following link:

(2) brain tumor dataset
The brain tumor detection dataset consists of medical images from MRI or CT scans, containing information about brain tumor presence, 
location, and characteristics. This dataset is essential for training computer vision algorithms to automate brain tumor identification, 
aiding in early diagnosis and treatment planning.

The orignal brain tumor dataset can be found in the following repository:
https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/blob/main/ultralytics/cfg/datasets/brain-tumor.yaml.
We also uploaded this dataset in this repository.

2. Experimental Code

We will soon release our experimental CODE.
